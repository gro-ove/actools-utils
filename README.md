# AcTools Utils

Some utils and obsolete libraries from [AcTools](https://github.com/gro-ove/actools/).

## Common libraries

- ### [AcTools.Kn5Render](https://github.com/gro-ove/actools-utils/tree/master/AcTools.Kn5Render)
    First, basic DX11 renderer. Basic forward rendering without any features. Code is very bad, almost everything in one class, but it does a lot of cool stuff apart from being a custom showroom: it generates [new ambient shadows](http://i.imgur.com/i4vsn0M.png) with a pretty neat quality, [new track maps](https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/mjnn0Rr.png), finds livery colors. Also, of course, as a custom showroom it helps to draw new skins by [auto-reloading changed psd-files automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pGj1zKXgY0).
